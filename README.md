# Animation-Studio-Build
I am a lone physical design artist who is building a dream. A reality thought from my own mind. I need your help to make it a true reality. With narrative, world building and memorable characters development, I lack the support and so far funding for the project but I am compensating where I can. All contributions will be much appreciated. 
For contributors there will be a set of listing shown for reward for contributions all defined in the Funding The Shield section of my website, ashlersarchangelicrift.com . In order to claim reward, one has to contribute. And there are different levels defined of contribution rates all the way down to the chance to have your own Character based off of yourself ,as the contributor, and a few story based preferences discussed individually by myself and contributor to introduce your own character relevant to this growing and immersive storyline. 
With your contributions I will make this dream a reality so that I may entertain you all with a fresh narrative to enjoy and be a part of.
