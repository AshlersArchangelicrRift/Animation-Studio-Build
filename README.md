# Animation-Studio-Build
I am a lone physical design artist who is building a dream. A reality thought from my own mind. I need your help to make it a true reality. With narrative, world building and memorable characters development, I lack the support and so far funding for the project but I am compensating where I can. All contributions will be much appreciated.
